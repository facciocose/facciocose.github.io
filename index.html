        <h1>Ciao,</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Luca, an italian software developer.
            I've also been a videogames producer and a technical director in different fields.
            For all the details you can see my <a href="cv.html">CV</a>.

        <p>
            I think that <q>simple is better than complex</q><sup>[1]</sup>
            and that you have to <q>love people and use things because the opposite never works</q><sup>[2]</sup>.
        </p>

            This space used to contain my projects and my online presence but
            in recent years I have tried to devote myself mainly to offline activities.

            There is just a small utility library that I'm fond of and that I aperiodically try to keep updating:
            <a href="https://github.com/facciocose/django-italian-utils">django-italian-utils</a>
            a library which simplifies creation of italian applications.
